Simple MediaPlayer Sample
=========================

This sample demonstrates the use of `MediaPlayer`. Here are some important
things this sample highlights:

- Media playback position and duration are synchronized with a `Seekbar` in the UI.
- If the user manually changes the `Seekbar` position the `MediaPlayer` playback
  position is adjusted accordingly.
- State machine transitions for `MediaPlayer` are displayed in the UI.
- MP3 files are loaded from the `raw/res/` folder (no streaming over network).
